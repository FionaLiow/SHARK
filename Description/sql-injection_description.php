<p><strong>Data Theft: </strong>Attackers can steal sensitive information like user credentials, financial data, or personal details.</p>
<p><strong>Data Manipulation: </strong>They can alter data in the database, such as changing account balances or deleting critical information.</p>
<p><strong>Website Defacement: </strong>In some cases, attackers can even take control of the website and modify its content.</p>
