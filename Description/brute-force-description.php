<p>Brute forcing is a cyberattack where attackers systematically try all possible combinations of passwords or encryption keys until they find the correct one. Imagine it like trying every key on a lock until one unlocks the door.</p>
</br>
<p><strong>Brute forcing can target various systems and services:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Password Brute Force: </strong>Attempting to guess a user's password by trying many combinations.</p>
<p><strong>Credential Stuffing: </strong>Using a list of known passwords (from previous breaches) to try against multiple accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Dictionary Attack: </strong>Using a pre-defined list of likely passwords (dictionary) rather than all possible combinations.</p>
<p><strong>Reverse Brute Force: </strong>Starting with a common password and attempting it on many different usernames.</p>
</br>
<p><strong>Common Targets:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Login Pages: </strong>Trying multiple passwords to gain unauthorized access.</p>
<p><strong>Wireless Networks: </strong>Cracking Wi-Fi passwords.</p>
<p><strong>Encrypted Files: </strong>Decrypting files by trying multiple keys.</p>
